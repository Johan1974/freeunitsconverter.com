<h3 id="core-conversion">The Core Conversion Formula</h3>

<p>
  The meter (m) is the metric system’s base unit of length, while the yard (yd) is commonly used in the imperial system. The standard conversion is:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1 meter = 1.09361 yards</strong>
</p>

<p>
  To convert meters to yards manually, multiply the number of meters by 1.09361. For example:
</p>

<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  5 m × 1.09361 = 5.46805 yd
</div>

<h3 id="reverse-conversion">Reverse Conversion: Yards to Meters</h3>

<p>
  If you have measurements in yards and want to convert back to meters, the formula is:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meters = Yards ÷ 1.09361</strong>
</p>

<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  5.46805 yd ÷ 1.09361 = 5 m
</div>
