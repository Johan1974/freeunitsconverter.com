<h3 id="core-conversion">The Core Conversion Formula</h3>

<p>
  The foot (ft) is an imperial unit of length, while the millimeter (mm) belongs to the metric system. The standard conversion is:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1 foot = 304.8 millimeters</strong>
</p>

<p>
  To convert manually, multiply the number of feet by 304.8. For example:
</p>

<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  5 ft × 304.8 = 1,524 mm
</div>

<h3 id="reverse-conversion">Reverse Conversion: Millimeters to Feet</h3>

<p>
  If you have measurements in millimeters and want to convert them back to feet, the formula is:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Feet = Millimeters ÷ 304.8</strong>
</p>

<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  1,524 mm ÷ 304.8 = 5 ft
</div>
