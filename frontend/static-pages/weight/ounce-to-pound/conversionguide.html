<p>
An ounce is a smaller unit of mass commonly used in the United States, while a pound represents a larger standard weight unit in the imperial system. 
To convert ounces to pounds, divide the number of ounces by 16 because there are 16 ounces in a pound.
</p>

<p>
<strong>lb = oz ÷ 16</strong>
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
32 oz → 32 ÷ 16 = 2 lb
