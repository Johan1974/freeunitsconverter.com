</p>

<h3 id="core-conversion">The Core Conversion Formula</h3>
<p>
  The meter (m) is the base unit in the metric system, and the inch (in) is a standard unit in the imperial system. 
  The conversion is:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1 meter = 39.3701 inches</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To convert manually, multiply the number of meters by 39.3701. For example:
</p>
<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  2 m × 39.3701 = 78.7402 in
</div>

<h3 id="reverse-conversion">Reverse Conversion: Inches to Meters</h3>
<p>
  To convert inches back to meters, use the formula:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Meters = Inches ÷ 39.3701</strong>
</p>
<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  78.7402 in ÷ 39.3701 = 2 m
</div>
