<h3 id="core-conversion">The Core Conversion Formula</h3>

<p>
  The meter (m) is the base unit of length in the metric system, while the mile (mi) is commonly used in the imperial system. The standard conversion is:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1 meter ≈ 0.000621371 miles</strong>
</p>

<p>
  To convert meters to miles manually, multiply the number of meters by 0.000621371. For example:
</p>

<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  5,000 m × 0.000621371 ≈ 3.107 mi
</div>

<h3 id="reverse-conversion">Reverse Conversion: Miles to Meters</h3>

<p>
  To convert miles back to meters, use this formula:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Meters = Miles ÷ 0.000621371</strong>
</p>

<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  3.107 mi ÷ 0.000621371 ≈ 5,000 m
</div>
