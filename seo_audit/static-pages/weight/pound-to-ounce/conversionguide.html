<p>
A pound is a standard imperial unit of weight, primarily used in the United States, while an ounce is a smaller unit within the same system. 
To convert pounds to ounces, multiply the number of pounds by 16, as there are 16 ounces in one pound.
</p>

<p>
<strong>oz = lb × 16</strong>
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>
<div style="background:#f0f0f0; padding:0.5rem 1rem; border-radius:4px; display:inline-block; margin-bottom:1rem;">
5 lb → 5 × 16 = 80 oz
